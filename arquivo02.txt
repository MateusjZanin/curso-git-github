Segundo arquivo de teste dessa versão de teste do curso de git

Tangos de Malaga is a Flamenco song form originating from Malaga, Spain that can sound close to a Farruca, with the differences in the cante melodies that I outline here on guitar. It was fun to compose (originally for a dance choreography) and challenging to play! I use my alternail technique at the end to reach speeds I could not with traditional picado technique (forgive me).
The video was shot in Bellevue Washington overlooking the majestic Lake Sammamish. It is a good place to heal.
